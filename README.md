# Spotify Recommendation Demo

This project is a demonstration tool developed as part of my CE Project. It accompanies our presentation on the analysis of Spotify's recommendation algorithm. The demo simulates how Spotify recommends songs based on a user's region, listening history, and genre preferences. The application is built with Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses a simple Express server to serve the content.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this demo is to showcase a simplified version of Spotify's recommendation algorithm. Key features include:

- **Region and Genre Bias:** Initially, the recommendations are based on the userâ€™s selected region. As the user interacts with the demo by playing songs, the algorithm learns their genre preferences and starts recommending similar genres, even from different regions.
- **Promoted Songs:** A fraction of the songs are marked as "Promoted" and receive an additional boost in the recommendation score.
- **Randomized Elements:** The last few recommendations in the list are completely random to simulate diversity in suggestions.
- **Interactive Playback:** Users can play, pause, and navigate between songs with a dynamic, responsive UI.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Simple login with a username and region selection.
- **Dynamic Recommendations:** Recommendations update based on listening history and genre preference.
- **Themed UI:** Supports dark and light themes with a seamless switch.
- **Custom Player Controls:** Next, previous, and play/pause functionality.
- **Express Server:** Run the demo locally on [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
